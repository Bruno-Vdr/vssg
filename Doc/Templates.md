# Templates:

There are 3 differents pages type in the blog:

- topics_list pages, containing a list of available topics in the blog.
- push_list pages, containing a list of available push/article in a  topic.
- push pages, containing the articles.

Each page is generated by two templates, one for content, one for page style (css). All the templates files shoud be
in the same directory where points the VSSG_TEMPLATE_DIR environment variable.

There are 6 templates files used by vssg:
- push.tmpl : used as model for each push. It's an HTML file.
- push_style.tmpl : used as specific style for push pages. It's a CSS file.
- pushs_list.tmpl: used as model to generate the pages listing pushes in the topic. HTML file.
- pushs_list_style.tmpl: used as specific style for pages listing pushes in the topic. CSS file.
- topics_list.tmpl: used as model to generate the page listing all topics in blog. HTML file.
- topics_list_style.tmpl: used as specific style for pages listing topics in the blog. CSS file.

Here is a picture of a template directory where VSSG_TEMPLATE_DIR points to:

## Push template: push.tmpl:

That will be replaced by links to previous and next push (if any) by the **vssg chain** command. Theses tags are optional.

The last specificity of the template is the availability of 3 dynamics variables substituted, at push time by their
corresponding values:

- **[@date]** : The date of the push.
- **[@title]** : The title of the push.

## Push List template: pushs_list.tmpl:

This file is a template for generating a HTML page with link to various pushes in the blog. The template file MUST
provide a special section between [LinkModel] and [EndModel] tag:

![Terminal](pictures/link_model.png " Link models")

to generate any links in the push list page. It recognizes 4 dynamic variables, substituted on push time:

- **[@url]** : The url of the push page.
- **[@date]** : The date of the target push.
