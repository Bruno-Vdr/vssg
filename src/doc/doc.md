# vssg : V static site generator (Yet another one).

vssg is a CLI based static site generator, written in V language. This code was written
for a (my) personal use. As it could be useful for other, I put in  on github. The primary
goal of this SSG was simplicity, robustness and independence. The code is built using
[V language](https://vlang.io/).

3 ideas are used:

1. Blog: A structure containing 0-N topics.
2. Topic: Containing 0-N pushes.
3. Push: A single push/story or post



## Commands:

### init
