util.functions could be hardened.
documentation could be extracted from Command.help method.
Work on push.generate_push_html: split in more func or make util module member.

Rename VSSG_IMG_POST_DIR to VSSG_IMG_PUSH_DIR or whatever.

Replace :

Post
  	sections   []Section // Post core

By section map[string]Section

??

This would avoid doing it in Push generate_push_html (l 141)
